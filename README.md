# temp-cs-portfolio

A temporary portfolio to do the job while I find time to work on my comprehensive interdisciplinary portfolio. It is fully responsive to device screens of all sizes, and fully supports the user's dark and light mode preferences. It is made **completely from scratch** in Next.js. The backgrounds were created in Figma.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

* react-icons

### Backend

* Next.js framework (although this is a SPA, Next.js provides a number of features beyond plain React that are still beneficial for it, especially if this website were to expand in the future)

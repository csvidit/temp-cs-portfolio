# temp-cs-portfolio

A temporary made-from-scratch portfolio to do the job while I find time to work on my comprehensive interdisciplinary portfolio. It is fully responsive to device screens of all sizes, and fully supports the user's dark and light mode preferences. It is made **completely from scratch** in Next.js. The backgrounds were created in Figma.

My goal with this project was simple - create a consistent UI (almost creating a design language of consistent typography heirarchy, spacing, font styles, colors, and components). Everything is purposeful and there are animations (made using ```framer-motion``` or ```tailwindcss``` transitions) only where necessary. Conveying information effectively and cleanly is primary; everything else is secondary.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

* tailwindcss
* framer-motion
* react-icons

### Backend

* Node.js
* Next.js framework (although this is a SPA, Next.js provides a number of features beyond plain React that are still beneficial for it, especially if this website were to expand in the future)

## Future Enhancements

I am in the process of creating database schemas for the projects, so that I do not have to hardcode them. They will also have tiny icons for the technologies used in the projects shown in the bottom left of the card component. Coming Soon.
